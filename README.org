#+title: A sample Clojure project set up with Nix

Every time a dependency is added to `deps.edn`, you'll want to regenerate `deps-lock.edn`. Use the following command:

#+begin_src sh
 nix run github:jlesquembre/clj-nix#deps-lock
 #+end_src

Test code used in this repository comes from [[Graham Enos' article][https://grahamenos.com/ft-clojure-nix.html]]. Admittedly, though the mathematician's backstory is interesting, I didn't find the idea as novel as Graham did - it seems like a natural consequence of definitions - though maybe I'm missing something!
